## ⚠️ Important for Windows users

All terminal work must be done **inside WSL** (Ubuntu), not Windows PowerShell.

**Quick check:**
```bash
pwd
```
Should show `/home/...` not `C:\Users\...`

See: [Verify terminal context](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/workflows/verify-terminal-context.html)
