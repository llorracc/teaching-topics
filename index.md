## Current focus

**Unit 3: [Contribution](units/contribution/)** — Four-notebook MyST assembly, PRs, and AI revision

Students are assembling multi-notebook MyST documents from their ballpark papers: creating intro, prior-literature, and subsequent-literature notebooks, weaving them with the original via `myst.yml`, and submitting pull requests.

**Current orchestrator:** [MyST Assembly](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/orchestrators/05-myst-conversion.html)

## Important for Windows users

All terminal work must be done **inside WSL** (Ubuntu), not Windows PowerShell.

**Quick check:**
```bash
pwd
```
Should show `/home/...` not `C:\Users\...`

See: [Verify terminal context](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/workflows/verify-terminal-context.html)
