# Workflow: LitMaps import and visualize

**Purpose:** Import your bibliography into LitMaps and visualize citing papers.

**External resources:**
- [The Pitch (as.180.369)](https://github.com/llorracc/as.180.369/blob/main/materials/pitch/README.md)

**Note:** Free LitMaps accounts are limited to **2 maps**, **100 articles per map**, and **20 search inputs**. Work strategically within these limits.

## Verify first

### 1. Verify you have a LitMaps account

Go to https://www.litmaps.com and sign in.

**Expected:** You can access your LitMaps dashboard.

**If no account:** Create one at https://www.litmaps.com (free tier available).

---

### 2. Verify you have a .bib file ready

Check that you have a `.bib` file from PaperPile (from [google-drive-paperpile-sync](google-drive-paperpile-sync.md)).

**Expected:** You know the location of your `.bib` file on your computer.

---

## Steps

### 1. Import your bibliography

1. In LitMaps: click **Import** (top left)
2. Click **Choose File**
3. Navigate to your `.bib` file and select it
4. Click **Import**

**Expected:** LitMaps shows "X articles imported" or similar.

---

### 2. Create a LitMap

1. After import, click **Explore Related Articles**
2. LitMaps will show articles that cite your papers or are cited by them
3. Click **Add to Litmap** for articles you want to include

**Free tier limits:** 
- 100 articles per map (plenty for most uses)
- 2 maps total
- 20 search inputs

**Prioritize:**
- The original paper your ballpark is based on
- Key citing papers (recent work that builds on the paper)
- Don't try to add everything—focus on the most relevant

---

### 3. View your LitMap

1. Go to **My Litmaps** in the left sidebar
2. Click on your litmap to view the visualization
3. The map shows connections between papers (citations)

**What you're looking for:**
- Papers that cite your ballpark paper (forward citations)
- Clusters of related work
- Recent papers that might be relevant to your project

---

### 4. Export for later use

1. With your litmap open, click the **share icon** (top right)
2. You can share via email or get a link
3. For bibliography: some export options may be available under the download icon

---

## Troubleshooting

**"0 articles imported":**
- The .bib file may be empty or malformed
- Try opening the .bib file in a text editor to verify it has content
- Re-export from PaperPile if needed

**"Limit reached" when adding articles:**
- Free tier has article limits (100 articles per map, 2 maps total)
- See "Working within free tier limits" below
- Use your second map if you need more space

**Can't find related articles:**
- Some papers may not be in LitMaps' database
- Try searching for the paper by title directly in LitMaps

---

## Working within free tier limits

With 100 articles per map and 2 maps, prioritize strategically:

**Must include:**
1. The original paper your ballpark is based on
2. 3-5 foundational papers it cites (the "giants" it stands on)

**High priority:**
3. 5-10 most recent papers citing your paper (forward citations)
4. 3-5 highly cited papers from the bibliography

**Skip:**
- Tangentially related papers
- Papers you can't access
- Very old foundational work (unless directly relevant)

**Alternative:** Create multiple focused litmaps:
- "Foundational papers" — the theoretical basis
- "Recent developments" — papers from last 3 years
- "Methodology papers" — if relevant to replication
