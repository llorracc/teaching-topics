# Workflows index

Atomic, reusable in-class workflow steps. Each workflow is a standalone document that can be referenced by orchestrators.

---

## ⚠️ Before you start any workflow

1. **Check your working directory** — Most workflows require you to be in `~/GitHub/econ-ark/ballpark`
2. **Complete verification steps** — Each workflow has a "Verify first" section at the top
3. **Windows users:** Ensure you're in WSL/Ubuntu, not Windows

**Quick check:**
```bash
cd ~/GitHub/econ-ark/ballpark && pwd
```

## Verification (foundational)

- [Verify terminal context](_verify-terminal-context.md) — Ensures correct filesystem and directory

---

## Git

- [Git fetch/pull on ballpark](git-fetch-pull-ballpark.md) — Working dir: `ballpark/`
- [Git add, commit, and PR](git-commit-and-pr.md) — Working dir: `ballpark/`

## PaperPile & LitMaps

- [PaperPile setup and sharing](paperpile-setup-and-sharing.md) — Browser-based
- [Google Drive sync for PaperPile](google-drive-paperpile-sync.md) — Browser + filesystem
- [LitMaps import and visualize](litmaps-import-and-visualize.md) — Browser-based

## Cursor & environment

- [Launch Cursor in ballpark](launch-cursor-in-ballpark.md) — Working dir: `ballpark/` ⚠️ Critical
- [Install the environment (via Cursor)](cursor-environment-install.md) — Working dir: `ballpark/`

## Jupyter notebooks

- [Open Jupyter notebook in Cursor](jupyter-notebook-in-cursor.md) — Cursor root: `ballpark/` ⚠️ Critical
- [Add yourself as coauthor](add-coauthor-to-notebook.md)

## MyST

- [Install MyST-Markdown extension](install-myst-extension.md)
- [Install MyST (CLI)](install-myst-cli.md)
- [Convert notebook to MyST](convert-notebook-to-myst.md)

## Bibliography

- [Set up bibliography files for MyST](bibliography-setup-myst.md) — Working dir: `ballpark/`
- [Add a citation to the paper](add-citation-to-paper.md)
- [Add LitMap image and subsequent-literature bib](add-litmap-image-and-bib.md)

## AI-assisted

- [Add "Subsequent Literature" section (AI-assisted)](ai-subsequent-literature-section.md)
