# Workflow: Ask Cursor about a MyST extension (and how to install it)

**Purpose:** Use Cursor itself to determine whether there is an extension for working with MyST Markdown, and to get installation steps that match the student’s platform.

---

## Steps

1. In Cursor, open chat and ask:
   > "Is there a VS Code / Cursor extension for working with MyST Markdown documents? If yes, what is it called and how do I install it in Cursor?"

2. If Cursor says **yes**, follow its installation instructions.
   - If Cursor suggests installing from a marketplace and you can’t find it, ask:
     > "I don’t see it in Cursor’s Extensions search. Can you give me an alternative install method (e.g. VSIX) and step-by-step instructions?"

3. If Cursor says **no**, or if installation fails, proceed to the next workflow:
   - [Install MyST-Markdown extension](install-myst-extension.md)
