# Workflow: Convert notebook to MyST

> **OBSOLETE:** This workflow has been replaced by the **four-notebook MyST assembly** approach.
> Instead of converting a notebook to a `.md` file, students now create three new notebooks
> (intro, prior-literature, subsequent-literature) and weave them with the original via a
> `myst.yml` TOC. See the [MyST Assembly orchestrator](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/orchestrators/05-myst-conversion.html).

**Purpose:** Convert an existing Jupyter notebook into a MyST document.

---

## Steps

1. Ask Cursor:
   > "How do I convert this existing Jupyter notebook to become a MyST document?"
2. Follow the instructions to generate a MyST version of your notebook.
