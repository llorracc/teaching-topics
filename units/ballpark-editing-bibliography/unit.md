# Unit: Ballpark Editing & Bibliography Workflow

## Overview

This unit covers working with ballpark papers: forking the repo, editing Jupyter notebooks, using PaperPile and LitMaps for bibliography management, converting to MyST, adding citations, and creating pull requests.

By the end of this unit, students should have:
- Forked the ballpark repo and added themselves as coauthor to their chosen paper
- Set up PaperPile with JHU library access and created a bibliography
- Used LitMaps to visualize citing literature
- Converted their notebook to MyST format with proper citations
- Submitted a PR with their improvements
