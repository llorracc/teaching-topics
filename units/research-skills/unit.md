# Unit: Research Skills

## Overview

This unit teaches research skills using the ballpark paper as a vehicle: bibliography management, literature discovery, and AI-assisted analysis.

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- Build and manage bibliographies with PaperPile
- Discover subsequent literature using LitMaps
- Use AI (iteratively, with both free and frontier models) to analyze research literature
- Critically evaluate AI outputs and identify limitations
