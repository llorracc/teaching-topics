# Assignment: AI revision with prompt tracking

**Due:** Before the following class

---

## Overview

Use AI to revise and improve the existing content of your ballpark notebook.

---

## What to do

For each AI-assisted change, record:

1. **The prompt you used.**
2. **What the AI changed.**
3. **Any manual edits you made afterward.**

---

## Deliverable

Submit your improved notebook along with a **prompt log** (a markdown file or section in the notebook) that documents each prompt and its result.

---

## Example prompt log entry

```markdown
### Prompt 1
**Prompt:** "Improve the clarity of the introduction paragraph."

**AI changes:** Rewrote the first paragraph to be more concise; added a topic sentence.

**Manual edits:** Changed "utilize" to "use"; fixed a typo.
```

## Tips

- Use small, focused prompts rather than asking for sweeping changes.
- Review each AI output before accepting.
- If the AI makes a mistake, document it and correct it manually.
