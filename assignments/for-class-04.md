# Assignments for Class 04

Complete before arriving at Class 04:

| Assignment | Deliverable |
|------------|-------------|
| [Prior Literature Summary](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/assignments/prior-literature.html) | `prior-literature.md` |
| [Subsequent Literature](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/assignments/subsequent-literature.html) | `subsequent-literature.bib` + analysis |

030 and 040 can be done in parallel — both feed into the four-notebook MyST assembly (Class 05).
