# Assignments for Class 06

Complete before arriving at Class 06.

You’re moving from ballpark (notebooks) to REMARK (full replication). This assignment has two parts:

1. **[LaTeX version of your ballpark paper](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/assignments/latex-version-of-ballpark-paper.html)** — Create a LaTeX version of the ballpark paper you’ve been working on (using MathPix Snip if possible).

2. **[Paper topic choice and REMARK repo setup](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/assignments/paper-topic-choice-and-remark-setup.html)** — Choose your path (auditing / for-credit option 1 or 2) and set up your REMARK repo from the HAFiscal template.

Each part has its own steps and deliverable; see the linked pages for full instructions.
