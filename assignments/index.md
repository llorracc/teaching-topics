## What's Next (Class 05+)

In the next class, you will:
1. Learn to upgrade existing ballpark items with MyST and modern bibliography tools
2. Prepare pull requests to modernize ballpark objects
3. **Create your own ballpark objects** based on your deep dive

Your `paper-deep-dive.md` will be the foundation for creating your ballpark entry.
