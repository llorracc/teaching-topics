# Assignment: Prior Literature Summary

**Due:** Before next class  
**Time:** ~20-30 minutes

**Prerequisite:** [PaperPile Bibliography](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/assignments/paperpile-bibliography.html) — you need your `.bib` file.

---

## Objective

Use AI to write a **1-2 paragraph summary** of the prior literature that your ballpark paper builds on.

---

## Steps

### 1. Give your .bib to AI

Open Cursor and use this prompt:

> "Here is the bibliography (.bib file) from [paper title by authors, year]. These are the papers it cites.
>
> Please write a 1-2 paragraph summary of the prior literature that this paper builds on. What were the key ideas, models, or findings from these cited papers that made this paper possible?
>
> [Paste your .bib file contents here]"

---

### 2. Iterate if needed

If the summary is too generic, ask follow-ups:
- "Which of these papers were most foundational?"
- "What gap in the prior literature was this paper addressing?"

---

### 3. Save your summary

Save as `prior-literature.md` (a working document for Assignment 050):

```markdown
# Prior Literature Summary: [Paper Title]

## The papers my ballpark paper cites

[1-2 paragraph summary from AI]

## Key foundational papers

- [Paper 1]: [Why it matters]
- [Paper 2]: [Why it matters]
- [Paper 3]: [Why it matters]
```

---

## Deliverable

`prior-literature.md` with:
- 1-2 paragraph summary
- 3-5 key foundational papers

**Keep this short.** Background context, not a literature review.

---

## If You Get Stuck

**Ask Cursor AI.** If the "auto" model is inadequate, try **Claude Opus 4.5** or **ChatGPT 5.2**. If both agree, the answer is probably correct.
