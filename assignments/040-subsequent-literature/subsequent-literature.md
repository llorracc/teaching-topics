# Assignment: Subsequent Literature

**Due:** Before next class  
**Time:** ~45-60 minutes

**Prerequisite:** Complete [Assignment 030: Prior Literature](../030-prior-literature/prior-literature.md) first.

---

## Objective

1. Use **LitMaps** to find papers that CITE your ballpark paper
2. Export those citing papers as a `.bib` file
3. Use **AI** to analyze what the subsequent literature tells us about where the field has gone

---

## Part A: Find Citing Papers with LitMaps

### 1. Sign in to LitMaps

Go to https://www.litmaps.com and sign in (or create a free account).

**Free account limits:** 2 maps, 100 articles per map, 20 search inputs. This is sufficient.

---

### 2. Find your ballpark paper

Search for your ballpark paper by title or author. Add it as the **seed article** for a new LitMap.

---

### 3. Discover citing papers

Click **Discover** to find related articles. LitMaps shows:
- Papers **cited by** your paper (backward — older papers) 
- Papers **citing** your paper (forward — newer papers)

**You want the CITING papers** — those published AFTER your ballpark paper.

---

### 4. Add citing papers to your map

Select 20-50 relevant citing papers. Prioritize:
- Highly cited papers
- Recent papers (last 3-5 years)
- Papers directly relevant to your topic

---

### 5. Export as BibTeX

1. Click the **download/export icon**
2. Select **BibTeX** format
3. Save as `subsequent-literature.bib` **in your ballpark paper's folder**

---

## Part B: AI Analysis of the Subsequent Literature

### 6. Give the .bib to AI

Open Cursor and use this prompt:

> "Here is a bibliography of papers that have cited [your ballpark paper title] since it was published:
>
> [Paste your subsequent-literature.bib contents]
>
> Please analyze this subsequent literature:
> 1. What research directions have emerged from this paper?
> 2. What are the cutting-edge topics being explored now?
> 3. What methodological advances have been made?
> 4. What open questions or debates exist?
> 5. Which 3-5 papers seem most important for understanding where this field is heading?"

---

### 7. Iterate with follow-up questions

Don't accept the first answer. Push deeper:
- "Can you be more specific about the methodological advances?"
- "What gaps remain in this literature?"
- "What would a researcher need to know to contribute here?"

---

### 8. Document your analysis

Save `subsequent-literature-analysis.md` **in your ballpark paper's folder**:

```markdown
# Subsequent Literature Analysis: [Paper Title]

## Papers that cite my ballpark paper

I found [X] papers in LitMaps that cite [paper title].

## What the subsequent literature tells us

[2-3 paragraphs covering: What research directions emerged? What's cutting-edge now? What open questions remain?]

## Most important subsequent papers

1. [Paper]: [Why important]
2. [Paper]: [Why important]
3. [Paper]: [Why important]
```

---

## Deliverables

Both files go in your ballpark paper's folder:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `subsequent-literature.bib` | BibTeX of papers citing your ballpark paper |
| `subsequent-literature-analysis.md` | AI-assisted analysis (2-3 paragraphs + key papers) |

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't find my paper in LitMaps":**
- Try searching by DOI
- Try exact title match
- Some working papers may not be indexed

**"No citing papers found":**
- Your paper may be very recent
- Document this — we'll discuss alternatives in class

**"Too many citing papers":**
- Be selective — focus on most cited and most recent
- Quality over quantity

---

## Next Step

After completing this, proceed to [Assignment 050: Integration and PR](../050-integration-and-pr/integration-and-pr.md).
