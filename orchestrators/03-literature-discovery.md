# Orchestrator: Literature Discovery

**Phase:** Skills  
**Time:** ~15 minutes

## Purpose

Use LitMaps to discover papers that cite your ballpark paper (the "subsequent literature").

---

## Prerequisites

- `.bib` file from PaperPile (from [Bibliography Capture](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/orchestrators/02-bibliography-capture.html))
- LitMaps account (free tier is sufficient)

---

## Ask Cursor First

> "I have a paper titled [your ballpark paper title]. I want to find papers that have cited it since publication. What should I look for when selecting which citing papers are most important?"

---

## Workflow sequence

### 1. [LitMaps import and visualize](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/workflows/litmaps-import-and-visualize.html)

Import bib from PaperPile; create a map showing papers that cite your paper.

**Key points:**
- Import your `.bib` file from PaperPile
- Find YOUR ballpark paper (not just its references)
- Create a LitMap with your paper as the **seed**
- Filter for **citing papers only** (forward citations, published AFTER your paper)
- Export as `subsequent-literature.bib`

**Deliverable:** `subsequent-literature.bib` containing 20-50 relevant citing papers

---

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding, verify:
- [ ] LitMap shows your ballpark paper as the seed
- [ ] You've identified papers that CITE your paper (not just papers IT cites)
- [ ] `subsequent-literature.bib` is saved locally
