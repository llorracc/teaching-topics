# Orchestrators

Orchestrators sequence multiple workflows into coherent skill-building modules.

## Course Progression

Orchestrators follow the **Tools → Skills → Artifacts** progression:

```
01-Environment ──► 02-Bibliography ──► 03-Literature ──► 04-Notebook ──► 05-MyST ──► 06-Contribution
     Setup              Capture          Discovery         Editing       Assembly
   (Tools)           (Tools/Skills)      (Skills)         (Skills)      (Skills)     (Artifacts)
```

## Modular Orchestrators

| # | Orchestrator | Phase | Time | Description |
|---|--------------|-------|------|-------------|
| 01 | [Environment Setup](01-environment-setup.md) | Tools | ~15 min | Git, Cursor, environment, open notebook |
| 02 | [Bibliography Capture](02-bibliography-capture.md) | Tools/Skills | ~20 min | PaperPile setup, BibTeX export |
| 03 | [Literature Discovery](03-literature-discovery.md) | Skills | ~15 min | LitMaps, find citing papers |
| 04 | [Notebook Editing](04-notebook-editing.md) | Skills | ~10 min | Add coauthor to notebook |
| 05 | [MyST Assembly](05-myst-conversion.md) | Skills | ~45 min | Four-notebook assembly with TOC and bibliography |
| 06 | [Contribution](06-contribution.md) | Artifacts | ~15 min | Fork, commit, create PR |

## Typical Class Session

A class might cover 2-3 orchestrators:

**Class 03:** Orchestrators 01-03 (Environment, Bibliography, Literature Discovery)
**Class 04:** Orchestrator 05 (MyST Assembly) — four-notebook structure introduced and started

## Legacy: Full Session Orchestrator

The original monolithic orchestrator is preserved for reference:
- [Ballpark editing, Jupyter, MyST, and bibliography](ballpark-jupyter-myst-bibliography.md) — 17 steps in sequence

This has been split into the modular orchestrators above for better pacing.
