---

## Ask Cursor Throughout

For any Git questions:
> "I'm trying to [describe what you want to do]. What Git command should I use?"

---

## Workflow sequence

### 1. [Add yourself as coauthor](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/workflows/add-coauthor-to-notebook.html)

Add your name to the notebook; save.

**Key points:**
- Find the authors cell (usually near the top)

**Deliverable:** Notebook shows you as a coauthor
