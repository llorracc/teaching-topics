## Ask Cursor First

> "I need to build a bibliography for an academic paper. What tools and approaches would you recommend?"

---

## Workflow sequence

### 1. [PaperPile setup and sharing](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/workflows/paperpile-setup-and-sharing.html)

Connect to JHU libraries; create and share folders; verify shared content.

**Deliverable:** PaperPile library contains references from your ballpark paper

---

### 2. [Google Drive sync for PaperPile](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/workflows/google-drive-paperpile-sync.html)

Get PaperPile files available locally via Google Drive.

**Critical:** Set up both:
1. Cloud storage connection (for PDFs)
2. **BibTeX Export Workflow** (for `.bib` files) ← Most students miss this!

**Deliverable:** `.bib` file appears in your Google Drive PaperPile folder

---

## Checkpoint

Before proceeding, verify:
- [ ] PaperPile has your ballpark paper's references
- [ ] BibTeX Export Workflow is configured (Profile → Workflows and Integrations)
- [ ] `.bib` file is accessible in Google Drive
