# Orchestrator: Bibliography Capture

**Phase:** Tools → Skills  
**Time:** ~20 minutes

## Purpose

Set up PaperPile to capture and export bibliographies for your ballpark paper.

---

## Prerequisites

- JHU credentials (for library access)
- Google account
- Completed [Environment Setup](01-environment-setup.md)

---

## Ask Cursor First

> "I need to build a bibliography for an academic paper. What tools and approaches would you recommend?"

---

## Workflow sequence

### 1. [PaperPile setup and sharing](../workflows/paperpile-setup-and-sharing.md)

Connect to JHU libraries; create and share folders; verify shared content.

**Deliverable:** PaperPile library contains references from your ballpark paper

---

### 2. [Google Drive sync for PaperPile](../workflows/google-drive-paperpile-sync.md)

Get PaperPile files available locally via Google Drive.

**Critical:** Set up both:
1. Cloud storage connection (for PDFs)
2. **BibTeX Export Workflow** (for `.bib` files) ← Most students miss this!

**Deliverable:** `.bib` file appears in your Google Drive PaperPile folder

---
