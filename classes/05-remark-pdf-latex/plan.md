# Class 05: REMARK deep dive & PDF to LaTeX — Plan

**Unit:** [Research Skills](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/units/research-skills/unit.html) / [Contribution](https://llorracc.github.io/workspace-course-topics/units/contribution/unit.html)  
**Date:** TBD

## Pre-class assignments

Students arrive having completed: [Assignments for Class 05](../../assignments/for-class-05.md)

---

## Learning objectives

- **PR review:** Give and receive feedback on ballpark PRs (structure, MyST, citations).
- **PDF to LaTeX:** Use PDF-to-LaTeX converters (snip.MathPics, Nougat, Underleaf) to convert (part of) a paper.
- **REMARKs:** Understand what a REMARK is, REMARK requirements, and how REMARKs relate to ballpark (ballpark → REMARK pipeline).
- **Next phase:** Choose a replication target (extend existing REMARK/ballpark vs new REMARK).

---

## In-class workflow

### Part 1: Review students' PRs for ballpark updates (~20 min)

- Walk through open PRs; feedback on structure, MyST, citations.
- Note common issues for future reference.

### Part 2: Convert a paper to LaTeX (~25 min)

- **PDF-to-LaTeX converters:** snip.MathPics, Nougat, Underleaf.
- In-class: convert (part of) a paper to LaTeX via snip.MathPics.

### Part 3: Deep dive — existing REMARKs and REMARK requirements (~25 min)

- What a REMARK is (replication, structure, repo).
- REMARK requirements (documentation, code, tables/figures, reproducibility).
- How REMARKs relate to ballpark (ballpark → REMARK pipeline).

### Part 4: Bridge to next phase (~10 min)

- From "ballpark coauthor + MyST" to "choose a replication target."
- Clarify: extending an existing ballpark/REMARK vs proposing a new REMARK.

*(Optional)* **Housekeeping / Q&A** — Due dates, where to post paper choice, parking lot.

## Key resources

- **PDF-to-LaTeX:** snip.MathPics, Nougat (e.g. `pip install nougat-ocr`), Underleaf.
- **REMARK repo and requirements:** (add links when finalized)
- **Econ-ARK ballpark:** https://github.com/econ-ark/ballpark

## Assignments for next class

Complete before the next class: [Assignments for Class 06](../../assignments/for-class-06.md)

**Either:** choose a paper to replicate as a REMARK (with "extend existing vs new") **or** make a detailed proposal for a paper you want to write yourself and turn into a REMARK.

- **Replication path:** Pick a paper you're interested in replicating as a full REMARK. If the paper already has a REMARK or a ballpark entry, you can (a) extend/improve that REMARK or ballpark, or (b) pick a different paper for a new REMARK. Post your choice and one sentence on "extend existing vs new" so we can avoid overlap.
- **Original-paper path:** Make a detailed proposal for a paper you want to write yourself and turn into a REMARK.

*Deliverable (adjust as needed):* e.g. post in [discussion/canvas/email] by [date]: paper title, link (if replication), and one sentence on replication "extend vs new" or that it's an original-paper proposal; or submit a short proposal document.
