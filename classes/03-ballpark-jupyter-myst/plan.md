## Overview

This class introduces ballpark editing with Jupyter notebooks, MyST conversion, bibliography setup, and creating a PR.

---

## Learning objectives

- **Git/GitHub:** Clone and fork repos; each student creates a fork of the ballpark repo.
- **Jupyter & MyST:** Use Jupyter notebooks and MyST Markdown for documents; understand how they fit into JupyterBook builds.
- **BibTeX in JupyterBooks/MyST:** Create and use `.bib` files; cite references in MyST/JupyterBook content.
- **MathPix:** Use MathPix to capture equations from PDFs/images into LaTeX or markdown.
